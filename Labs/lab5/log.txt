    User is done... I think... Course now passes the test file. CourseDB is done... I'm pretty sure... DB interface is done. UserDB might be finished... I think Professor is done but Lamdas are weird...Student is done? again Lamdas are weird... Course Comparator was done but I forgot to Git when i finished it. Backend might be done but I wont know until I test it. I added everything I needed to SIS so it handles the commands. Now everything is properly commented.
